# Orangefox Recovery for google Pixel 7a (lynx)

This is still "work in progress". 
It seems to boot now at least, but Touch seems to be broken. 

Based on May 2024 A14 Kernel

## Installation methods:

## From recovery:
adb sideload the OrangeFox-R11.1-Unofficial-lynx.zip

## From bootloader/fastboot:
fastboot flash vendor_boot OrangeFox-R11.1-Unofficial-lynx.img
