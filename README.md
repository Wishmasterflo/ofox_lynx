# Orangefox Recovery for google Pixel 7a (lynx)

This is still "work in progress". 
It seems to boot now at least but the Touch screen is not working at the moment and the colors are more a BlueFox instead of OrangeFox now. 

Based on July 2024 A14 Kernel

## Installation methods:

## From recovery:
adb sideload OrangeFox-R11.1-Unofficial-lynx.zip

## From bootloader/fastboot:
fastboot flash vendor_boot OrangeFox-R11.1-Unofficial-lynx.img
